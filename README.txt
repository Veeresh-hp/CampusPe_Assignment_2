Student Name: Veeresh H P

Questions Attempted:
This project includes 20 Python scripts covering a wide range of fundamental concepts, from simple calculators to complex number system functions.
1. Personal Bio Card
2. Simple Calculator
3. String Manipulator
4. Age Calculator
5. Bill Splitter
6. Grade Calculator
7. Temperature Converter
8. Leap Year Checker
9. Ticket Pricing System
10. ATM Simulator
11. Number Pattern Printer
12. Multiplication Table Generator
13. Sum Average Calculator
14. Factorial Calculator
15. Prime Number Checker
16. Number Guessing Game
17. Palindrome Checker
18. Calculator Using Functions
19. Text Analysis Functions
20. Number System Functions

Special Instructions:
- Run each script using the Python interpreter (e.g., `python script_name.py`).
- Most scripts are interactive—please follow the on-screen prompts for the best experience.
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Challenges Faced:
Building these scripts was an insightful journey! One of the main challenges was ensuring robust user input handling, especially in interactive tools like the ATM Simulator and the Mathematical Function Suite. Dealing with edge cases—like preventing division by zero or managing non-numeric inputs—required careful validation. 

Designing the Number Pattern Printer and the logic for Armstrong and Perfect numbers also tested my algorithm-thinking skills. It was satisfying to see everything come together in the final Suite of functions!
