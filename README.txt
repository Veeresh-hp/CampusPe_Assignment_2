---------------------------------------------------------

Student Name: Veeresh H P

Questions Attempted:
This project includes 20 Python scripts covering a wide range of fundamental concepts, from simple calculators to complex number system functions.
1. Personal Bio Card
2. Simple Calculator
3. String Manipulator
4. Age Calculator
5. Bill Splitter
6. Grade Calculator
7. Temperature Converter
8. Leap Year Checker
9. Ticket Pricing System
10. ATM Simulator
11. Number Pattern Printer
12. Multiplication Table Generator
13. Sum Average Calculator
14. Factorial Calculator
15. Prime Number Checker
16. Number Guessing Game
17. Palindrome Checker
18. Calculator Using Functions
19. Text Analysis Functions
20. Number System Functions

Special Instructions:
- Run each script using the Python interpreter (e.g., `python script_name.py`).
- Most scripts are interactive—please follow the on-screen prompts for the best experience.
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Challenges Faced:

Working on this assignment was both challenging and rewarding. One of the key difficulties was handling user inputs properly, especially in interactive programs like the ATM Simulator and the Mathematical Function Suite. Ensuring the programs handled invalid inputs without crashing required careful use of validation techniques and exception handling.

Designing logic-heavy programs such as:
    Number Pattern Printer
    Armstrong Number Checker
    Perfect Number Validator
    Prime Number Range Generator

helped improve my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.

This assignment significantly strengthened my confidence in Python fundamentals. It helped me understand how to structure programs cleanly, manage edge cases effectively, and think logically while solving problems.
